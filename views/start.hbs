    <h4>How do I make a good video?</h4>

    <p>A video with tips is coming here.</p>

    <p>A few tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your phone camera is probably pretty good! But remember to film holding your phone horizontally and not vertically.</li>
      <li>Include your friends. People are interesting.</li>
      <li>Aim to elicit positive, high-arousal emotions. Nelson-Field et al. and Jonah Berger show that such content is shared more frequently.</li>
      <li>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-PbBZqayY"> 5-minute intro to making interesting videos</a>.</li>
